# Interview Scheduler
A react app in which admin can schedule a meeting by selecting the participants, start time, end time and date of the meeting. The admin have create/schedule interviews such that a person should not be having multiple interviews or meetings at the same time or overlapping time intervals.

In this I have used MERN stack.

## Steps to set-up
#### 1. install node.js into the machine
#### 2. Run this command 'npm i'
#### 3. after the completion open server in the terminal and hit 'npm run dev'. This will create a server which will connect with the frontend and work accordongily.
#### 4. When your server is live, open client and run 'npm run start'. This will open the UI on the local host.
#### 5. Now you are good to go.

## Functions that can be performed
#### 1. Scheduling an interview
#### 2. Editing of an already scheduled interview
#### 3. Deletion of a scheduled interview
